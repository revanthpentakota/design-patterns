 *  Once the connObject is created, the other threads will not be synchronized
 *  for null checks unlike synchronized lazy initialization, that will reduce
 *  synchronization overhead.
 *
 *  i.e., if T1 created connObject, T2, T3, T4... incoming threads
 *  no need to wait since connObject is already made available by T1.
 *
 *  If T2, T3 are waiting at synchronized block, after T1 releases lock then
 *  T2 might be creating another instance violating Singleton Pattern.
