Behavioral Design Patterns :

    1. Behavioral Design Patterns are a category of design patterns that focus on how objects
       interact and communicate with each other.
    2. These patterns define how responsibilities are shared among objects and help manage
       complex control flows, algorithm execution and object collaboration.

What they do :

    1. Focus on behavior and communication between objects.
    2. Help manage runtime interactions and responsibilities.
    3. Promote loose coupling between interacting classes.

Design Patterns :

    1. Strategy      :  Selects an algorithmâ€™s behavior at runtime.
    2. Observer      :  Notifies multiple objects when one object changes (pub-sub model).


Why Use Behavioral Patterns?

Scenario                                            :       Pattern
a. You want to switch algorithms at runtime	        :  Strategy
b. One change should notify many objects	        :  Observer
